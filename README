This is a very basic script that downloads a HTML transcript from wthashtag.com of the tweets that use a particular hashtag, parses the HTML using BeautifulSoup and extracts the contents of the tweets. These contents are then stripped of HTML tags and @ references, some keywords selectively removed and other keyword pairs joined up using ~ as a connector. The contents can then be fed into Wordle.net/create to generate a word cloud of the hashtag archive.
