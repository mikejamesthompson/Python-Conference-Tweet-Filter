  hmm, I hesitate to agree - probably better to check culture both in terms of depth *and* width? #  
   Hiya, Lee! Indeed! But then again country culture surely shapes the company culture to some degree, right? #  
 communities are coming up quickly with the community manager role. In the future the community should elect their managers. Thoughts? #  
  It isn't but the E2/socmed handwavers have done a fantastic job scaring the bejeezus out of many orgs #

  Hello partner in crime. Great discussion up at #  . Wish you were here :) 
 oh my -  you should be down here, great discussion and food for thought on cultural diversity #  
 Languages barriers are a reality. How do you address this? That's a key question for some companies #  
   : #  another key comment from  , these cultural issues were there way before ! So true!! 
  True, but that is why those issues should not be ignored, nor neglected, they need to be taken into account #

 Finally, the obvious synthesis by  : &quot;Both country and corp culture matter&quot; -- they do! #  
   Only 13% expect flatter hierarchy as result of #  &quot; (Prof. Thorsten Perry at #  ) Denial? HR managers audience. 
 Nice comment by  : companies should not mandate culture. Watch out with cultural stereotypes! #  
 Question to Renault: Do all communities use the same platform? A: No, internal Sharepoint, B2C &amp; B2B use others, not sure of the need #  
 my impression: corporate culture matters for adoption, country culture is only used to reject #  
 renault: jahrelange, kontrollierte community-piloten in der internen komm, jetzt schrittweiser rollout #  
 Great comment by E. Quintarelli: &quot;Technology, esp. US technology, has to do better to suppo diversity&quot; (i.e. languages) #  
 agrees w/  who doesn't buy &quot;ppl R ppl argument - national cultures go deep and it shows&quot; -&gt; national culture very relevant #  
 Interesting to say is that most  proj's in intern comp's sta in the US and come over to Eur. For  it's the other way around #  
 Wider than the country culture: defense debate. European have a strengh: we have a cultural knowledge of diversity #  
 Focus on our strengths in Europe as we have theexperience with cultural diversity in Europe w  implemtations says  #  
 Lee Bryant: &quot;We (Europeans) should leverage our cultural knowledge others may be lacking.&quot; #  
 . great comment by  at #  about leveraging diverse cultures - for us it's more a strength than a weakness, so go play with it
